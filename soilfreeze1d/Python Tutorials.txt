A very basic tutorial for making simple plots using matplotlib:
http://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html


Look at the package numpy:

dat = numpy.loadtxt('filename.txt', skiprows=1, delimiter=';')    # For reading the data in the file 'filename.txt'
                                                                  # and returning a numpy array with the name 'dat'

numpy.array     # the basic numpy array construct
numpy.max       # function/method to calculate the maximum of an array (along rows or columns, see numpy help)
numpy.min       # function/method to calculate the minimum of an array (along rows or columns, see numpy help)
numpy.mean      # function/method to calculate the average of an array (along rows or columns, see numpy help)

Use these commands to calculate and plot the trumpet of your temperature model
over the course of one year.
The easiest will be to ensure through the model setup that the data file only
contains results for one year. 
Slicing can be relatively easily done with numpy arrays, but that is another
abstraction layer.... you are welcome to try!
