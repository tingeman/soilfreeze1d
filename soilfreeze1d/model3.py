===============================================================================

This model script illustrates the use of the soilfreeze1d module for
calculating the thermal regime in embankment constructions.
The model first sets up and initializes a model of the natural soil.
After the model has been run for a sufficient amount of time to obtain
stable thermal conditions, the construction of an embankment is 
modelled by adding a five meter thick layer on top of the model.
 
This model is implemented using the stefan solution (phase change occurs 
linearly over a specified temperature interval).

The model is forced by a harmonic temperature variation at the upper boundary. 
The lower boundary has a specified constant gradient of 0.02 C/m.
Results will be written to the file model1_results.txt at a daily interval.
