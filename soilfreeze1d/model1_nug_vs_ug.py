===============================================================================

This model script illustrates the use of the soilfreeze1d module for 
calculating the thermal regime in a 1D model with one layer using the stefan 
solution (phase change occurs linearly over a specified temperature interval).
The model domain has an initial termperature of -2C at all nodes, and the 
model is forced by a harmonic temperature variation at the upper boundary. 
The lower boundary has a specified constant gradient of 0.08333 C/m.
Results will be written to the file model1_results.txt at a daily interval.
This verstion uses the non-uniform grid code, with a node spacing increase
factor of 1.1
